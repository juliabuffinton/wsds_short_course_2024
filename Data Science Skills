For technical skills, here's what I'd typically look for:
- strong programming skills (python is most common -- coursework is best way to build these)
- statistics coursework (one course would suffice)
- data visualization experience (Tableau is easy to pick up via MOOCs or just self-driven exploration)
- familiarity with big data solutions (have you heard of Spark, Hadoop? I am not sure how many undergrads have actual experience in this, so just awareness of the challenges and solutions) 
- familiarity with containerization/environment management (again mostly awareness not necessarily experience -- Docker is most common in my world)
- predictive analytics or machine learning (as a student or recent graduation, expectation is just that you have familiarity with this through coursework)
- critical thinking, communication, and teamwork skills (leadership in clubs are great ways to build these skills as a student!)

Not all companies will have technical interviews, but some places you can visit to practice coding:

- https://www.codewars.com/
- https://leetcode.com/
- https://www.hackerrank.com/

For discussion-based technical interviews, googling "Data science interview question prep" or something similar will turn up tons of practice Q&As... I don't have a strong preference there.

As a hiring manager, I'm mostly concerned with baseline technical skills and then critical thinking skills, teamwork, and other soft skills. I would rather have someone who can learn on my team than someone who knows everything and has a bad attitude :)
